## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM method


### What I learned

I found this project tremendously difficult. I had this idea that everything had to be completely responsive and interactive, but as I began learning about modular design, bem practice and working through this design I could see that actually the ability to reuse components is very powerful. I saw that for instance, parts of the footer moved about, but were essentially styled the same in each design. Previously I would have made the text responsively resize, but I definitely over did this and it's definitely not always necessary.

So to sum up:
Re-usable components are king and the BEM method is very useful for creating modular designs that incorporate re-usable components.

### Continued development

I'd like to continue working with images and background images. I feel very hacky when I try to get the various image components to work as desired.

I'd like to become more confident with the bem method and use it to create more websites.

I'd like to continue to learn more design patterns.

### Useful resources

- [Responsive img html best practice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images) - Although I didn't implement the ideas in this article, at one point I was reading through and thought it might come in useful at some point later on.
- [Embedding responsive images](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/multimedia-and-embedding/responsive-images/responsive.html) - Similar to the first article, I didn't feel that I need to implement the points and so I book marked it for a later point.
- [bem documentation](https://en.bem.info/methodology/quick-start/) - I believe this is the 'official' documentation that goes through best practice for the bem method.I found it really useful and encourage others to read it when they have the time.
